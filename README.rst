waf-tools
=========

Steinwurf uses `Waf`_ to build all the build system. This repository contains a
set of Waf tools.
These tools enable the Steinwurf software libraries to be built with a wide
range of compilers on various platforms. Furthermore special runner tools allow
unit tests to be executed directly on external target devices.
